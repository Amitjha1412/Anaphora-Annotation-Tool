# Anaphora-Annotation-Tool

Implemented an annotation tool to annotate pronouns and their corresponding
nouns with a minimal AI. The tool could look at word details given in an input file
and determine words which could be possible referents for a particular pronoun. The
project was done in JAVA using JavaSwings and JavaFX libraries.
